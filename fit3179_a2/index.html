                    Sharks are among the oldest living creatures on Earth, with an estimated age of around 400 million years, dating back to the Devonian period.
                    Across Australia, shark attacks have been regularly recorded by various public and private organizations, with the earliest incident being recorded in 1791.
                    As of 2024, there are now aproximately <b>1229</b> recorded shark attack incidents.
                    The following data vizualisation attempts to shed light on such data, and provide its readers with insightful information about shark attacks in Australia over the past few centuries.
                    The map below illustrates recorded shark attacks along with details regarding the month and year of each incident, the state where it happened, the latitude and longitude, the responsible shark species along with the victim's status following the shark attack.

                    The map above provides an illustration of the map of Australia (in grey) containing state lines (in white), along with the range of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters.
                    By utilizing the filters in the map above, it can be observed that the <b>most inland shark attack</b> occured during <b>October 1987 in the Nothern Territory (NT)</b> , and was caused by a Bull Shark.
                    In contrast, the <b>most remote attacks occured 3 times in Western Australia</b>, with their dates being recorded as <b>October 1986</b>, <b>July 2007</b> and <b>September 2009 respectively</b>.

                        When observing all-time shark attacks by state, <b>New South Wales (NSW)</b> has recorded the <b>highest number of 447 shark attacks</b>, followed by <b>Queensland (QLD)</b> with <b>371 shark attacks</b>.
                        This may be due to New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD) being popular destinations for surfing activities.
                        In contrast, the <b>Northern Territory (NT)</b> records the <b>lowest number of 19 shark attacks</b>, followed by <b>Tasmania (TAS)</b> with <b>28 shark attacks</b>.

                        In terms of fatalities, <span class="class-fatal">Queensland (QLD)</span> records the <span class="class-fatal">highest number of fatal shark attacks</span> at <span class="class-fatal">100 victims</span>,
                        whereas <b>New South Wales (NSW)</b> has the <b>highest number</b> of <span class="class-injured">injured shark attack victims (264)</span> as well as <span class="class-uninjured">uninjured shark attack victims (104)</span>.

                        <br>
                        Of the 1229 recorded shark attack incidents, a total of <span class="class-uninjured">228 victims (18.55%) emerged uninjured</span> from their shark attack encounters.
                        However, <span class="class-injured">746 victims (60.70%) sustained certain injuries</span>, whereas <span class="class-fatal">255 victims (20.75%) unfortunately perished</span> from their shark attack encounters.
                        These figures can be found on the waffle chart on the left.

                    From the dataset, it was found that the 4 most common sharks that were involved in shark attacks are <b>Great White Sharks, Tiger Sharks, Bull Sharks and Wobbegong Sharks</b>.
                    In the map below, incidents involving these 4 shark species have been visualised, allowing us to identify their locations and their habitats.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    By observing the map, it can be seen that Wobbegong Sharks can be found in coastal waters all around Australia.
                    Bull Sharks & Tiger Sharks are mostly present in the top half of the map, whereas Great White Sharks tend to stick to waters at the bottom half of the map.

                    Of the 1229 recorded shark attacks, Great White Sharks are mostly responsible for 371 (30.19%) incidents,
                    followed by Tiger Sharks at 229 (18.63%) incidents,
                    and then Bull Sharks & Wobbegong Sharks both at 202 (16.44%) incidents each.
                    Great White Sharks have also been found to have the largest difference in maximum and minimum recorded body sizes,
                    whereas Wobbegong Sharks seem to have smaller body sizes.
